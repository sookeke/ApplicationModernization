## Application Modernization - From Java EE in 2010 to Cloud-Native in 2021

This sample demonstrates how to modernize 10+ year-old Java EE applications with cloud-native technologies and the modern Java runtimes Quarkus and Open Liberty. The modernized application is deployed to and operated with OpenShift, the enterprise distribution of Kubernetes.

### Demonstrated Capabilities, Technologies and Tools

Application modernization is a journey. The legacy application has been modernized in ten steps.

1. Monolith - WebSphere Traditional 8.5.5
    - Java EE 6 app from 2008 with Db2 database running in VMs or bare metal.
2. Monolith - WebSphere Traditional 9 in container
    - Application converted with Transformation Advisor.
3. Monolith - WebSphere Liberty
    - Application converted with Eclipse Migration Tools.
4. Separated frontend
    - Dojo frontend in separate container.
5. Monolith - Open Liberty
    - Modern project structure.
6. Strangled Catalog Service and remaining Open Liberty Monolith
    - Strangled catalog service (inspired by Mono2Micro) developed with Quarkus and Postgres.
    - Event driven architecture via Kafka.
7. Strangled Catalog Service and remaining Quarkus Monolith
    - Strangled Quarkus catalog service uses reactive programming model.
    - Remaining Quarkus monolith runs as native executable.
8. Micro frontend based web application
    - Developed with single-spa and Vue.js. Messaging is done via RxJS.
9. CI/CD via Tekton
    - Target OpenShift. Via OpenShift Pipelines operator.
10. CI/CD via Tekton and ArgoCD
    - Target OpenShift. Via OpenShift GitOps operator.

### Deployment via Docker Desktop

If you want to run the modernized application locally, you can invoke the following commands. All you need is a local Docker installation and the git CLI.

Notes:
* Docker requires 14 GB memory, 10 CPUs and 80 GB disk space
* It takes roughly 15 - 20 minutes to start everything
* Make sure docker-compose is also installed (sounds like this needs to be installed separately on some systems)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nheidloff/application-modernization-javaee-quarkus.git && cd application-modernization-javaee-quarkus
$ ROOT_FOLDER=$(pwd)
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-docker/build-and-run.sh
```

The 'build-and-run.sh' script will launch the following containers.

Once everything has been started, you can open the web applications:

* Legacy Dojo frontend: http://localhost/CustomerOrderServicesWeb
* Modern micro-frontend based application: http://localhost:8080

See the [documentation](documentation/RunDemo.md) how to run the demo.


### Deployment to OpenShift with Tekton

Additionally you need to install Tekton. The easiest option is to use the '[OpenShift Pipelines](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/pipelines/installing-pipelines.html)' operator from the OperatorHub view in the OpenShift Console ([screenshots](documentation/deploy-tekton-1.png)). Simply accept all defaults. No local installations are necessary.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/nheidloff/application-modernization-javaee-quarkus.git && cd application-modernization-javaee-quarkus
$ ROOT_FOLDER=$(pwd)
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift-tekton/check-prerequisites.sh
$ oc login ...
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift/deploy-db2.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift/deploy-kafka.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift/deploy-postgres.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift-tekton/deploy-application.sh
$ sh ${ROOT_FOLDER}/scripts-openshift-tekton/show-urls.sh
```
